# Spotify-Clone

As part of my coding journey, I crafted a sleek and interactive Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skill in building a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly web app that brings seamless music playback right to your browser.

## Features-

- Play/Pause: Allows the user to start or pause the playback of the currently selected track.
- Next/Previous: Enables the user to skip to the next or previous track in the playlist or album.
- Seek: Allows the user to manually move forward or backward within a track by dragging a slider or clicking on a progress bar.
- Display the currently playing song and album artwork.

## Usage-

After opening the Spotify clone in your browser, click the play button beside a song to start playing it. You can control playback using the buttons at the bottom of the page. The "Now Playing" area shows the song and album cover thatâ€™s currently playing.
